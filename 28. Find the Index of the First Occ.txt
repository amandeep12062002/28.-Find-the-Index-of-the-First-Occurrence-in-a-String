Given two strings needle and haystack, return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.

 

Example 1:

Input: haystack = "sadbutsad", needle = "sad"
Output: 0
Explanation: "sad" occurs at index 0 and 6.
The first occurrence is at index 0, so we return 0.

Example 2:

Input: haystack = "leetcode", needle = "leeto"
Output: -1
Explanation: "leeto" did not occur in "leetcode", so we return -1.

 

Constraints:

    1 <= haystack.length, needle.length <= 104
    haystack and needle consist of only lowercase English characters.


class Solution {
public:
    int strStr(string haystack, string needle) {
        // Get the lengths of the haystack and needle
        int haystackLen = haystack.length();
        int needleLen = needle.length();
        
        // If the needle is empty, return 0 (as per problem definition)
        if (needleLen == 0) {
            return 0;
        }

        // Loop through the haystack to find the first occurrence of the needle
        for (int i = 0; i <= haystackLen - needleLen; i++) {
            // Check if the substring in haystack matches the needle
            if (haystack.substr(i, needleLen) == needle) {
                return i; // Return the index of the first occurrence
            }
        }
        
        // If needle is not found, return -1
        return -1;
    }
};
